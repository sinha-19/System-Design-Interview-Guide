# 01. Introduction to System Design

---

## What is System Design?

System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It is a critical skill for software engineers, especially when building scalable, reliable, and maintainable systems that serve millions of users.

## Why Do System Design Interviews Matter?

- **Evaluates real-world engineering skills:** Beyond algorithms and coding, it tests your ability to architect complex systems.
- **Assesses trade-off analysis:** System design is about making decisions with imperfect information and justifying choices.
- **Tests communication and leadership:** Explaining your design, asking clarifying questions, and defending your decisions are as important as the design itself.
- **Reflects day-to-day engineering:** Most engineering challenges on the job are architectural, not algorithmic.

---

## What is Expected in a System Design Interview?

- **High-level architecture diagrams**
- **Clear explanation of components and data flow**
- **Reasoning about scalability, reliability, and maintainability**
- **Awareness of trade-offs and alternatives**
- **Consideration of edge cases, security, and monitoring**
- **Effective communication and iterative clarification**

---

## What is Not Expected?

- **Perfect accuracy or completeness:** Focus is on structured thinking and reasoning, not textbook answers.
- **Production-ready code:** Pseudocode or block diagrams are sufficient.
- **Exhaustive coverage:** Prioritize key requirements and discuss trade-offs.

---

## Key System Design Principles

- **Scalability:** Can the system handle growth in users, data, or requests?
- **Availability:** Will the system be up and responsive when needed?
- **Reliability:** Is the system robust to failures and data loss?
- **Maintainability:** How easily can the system be changed or extended?
- **Performance:** Does the system meet latency and throughput goals?
- **Cost-efficiency:** Is the solution cost-effective for the expected scale?

## Typical System Design Interview Process

1. **Understand the Problem:** Clarify requirements and constraints.
2. **Estimate Scale:** Users, request rate, data size, latency, and throughput targets.
3. **Sketch High-Level Architecture:** Draw blocks for major components.
4. **Deep Dive on Components:** Focus on bottlenecks, data modeling, APIs, etc.
5. **Discuss Trade-offs:** Justify choices, consider alternatives.
6. **Talk Through Edge Cases:** Handle failures, scaling, data consistency, and security.
7. **Summarize & Answer Follow-ups:** Recap decisions and address open questions.

## Sample System Design Interview Questions

- Design a URL shortener like bit.ly.
- Design a scalable news feed (Twitter, Facebook).
- Design a messaging system like WhatsApp.
- Design a distributed file storage (Dropbox, Google Drive).
- Design a real-time collaborative document editor (Google Docs).
- Design an API rate limiter.
- Design a ride-sharing system (Uber, Lyft).

---

## Common Mistakes

- Jumping into the solution without clarifying requirements.
- Ignoring scale estimation.
- Focusing only on one aspect (like database) and ignoring others.
- Not discussing trade-offs.
- Running out of time without summarizing the design.

---

## Mindset for System Design

- **Think big, start simple:** Begin with a basic design, then iterate.
- **Communicate constantly:** Narrate your thought process and ask questions.
- **Be pragmatic:** There’s rarely a perfect answer.
- **Prioritize:** Focus on what matters most for the problem and audience.

## Real-World Application

Most software systems you use daily—social networks, e-commerce, streaming, and messaging—are the result of thoughtful system design. As systems grow, good architecture is the key differentiator between stable, scalable products and those that fail under pressure.

## Summary

System design is about understanding, architecting, and communicating solutions for real-world engineering challenges. Mastering these skills will improve both your interview performance and your effectiveness as a developer.

## Exercise

- Think of your favorite app. Sketch its high-level architecture on paper, identify key components, and consider how you might scale it to millions of users.
