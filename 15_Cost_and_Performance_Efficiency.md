# 15. Designing for Cost & Performance Efficiency

---

## Why Cost & Performance Matter

Efficient system design balances cost and performance, ensuring reliability and scalability without overspending.

---

## Cost-Efficient Design Principles

- **Right-size resources:** Donâ€™t over-provision servers or storage.
- **Auto-scaling:** Dynamically adjust resources to match load.
- **Use managed/cloud services:** Pay only for what you use.
- **Spot/Preemptible Instances:** Lower costs for non-critical workloads.
- **Tiered storage:** Store infrequently accessed data in cheaper storage.

---

## Performance Optimization

- **Caching:** Reduce load on backend and databases.
- **Load balancing:** Evenly distribute requests.
- **Efficient algorithms:** Choose the right data structures and algorithms.
- **Database tuning:** Use indexes, optimize queries.
- **Batch processing:** Reduce overhead by grouping operations.

---

## Monitoring Cost & Performance

- **Cost dashboards:** Track spend in real time (AWS Cost Explorer, GCP Billing).
- **Performance monitoring:** Use metrics, logs, and traces to spot bottlenecks.
- **Alerts:** Notify of cost overruns or performance degradation.

---

## Trade-offs

- Faster = more expensive (usually).
- High redundancy/availability increases costs.
- Precompute and cache vs. real-time computation.
- Multi-region deployments improve reliability but raise costs.

---

## FinOps (Financial Operations)

- Discipline of managing cloud spend.
- Collaborate between engineering, finance, and business.
- Set budgets, forecast, and optimize usage.

---

## Cloud Cost Optimization Tactics

- Turn off idle or underutilized resources.
- Use reserved or committed instances for steady workloads.
- Leverage spot/preemptible instances for savings.
- Move data to cheaper storage classes.

---

## Performance Testing

- Load test to determine scaling thresholds.
- Profile and benchmark critical paths.
- Tune for both average and peak loads.

---

## Cost Allocation

- Tag resources for project, environment, owner.
- Use chargeback or showback for accountability.

---

## Interview Questions

- How do you design a cost-efficient architecture for a video streaming service?
- What are the trade-offs between precomputing and on-demand computation?
- How do you monitor and control cloud spending?
- What techniques do you use for performance testing?

---

## Exercises

- Set up auto-scaling in AWS or GCP.
- Profile and optimize a slow web API.
- Create a cost dashboard using cloud billing tools.
- Simulate a performance test and tune the bottleneck.

## Summary

Designing for cost and performance ensures systems can scale without waste. Monitor, optimize, and revisit your architecture regularly for best results.
