# 14. Reliability, Failover & Disaster Recovery

---

## What is Reliability?

Reliability is the probability that a system will run without failure over a given period. Highly reliable systems minimize downtime and ensure business continuity.

---

## Designing for Reliability

- **Redundancy:** Duplicate critical components (servers, databases, networks).
- **Replication:** Multiple copies of data for durability and failover.
- **Failover:** Automatic switch to backup systems when primary fails.
- **Graceful Degradation:** Continue partial functionality if some components fail.

---

## Disaster Recovery (DR)

Disaster recovery is the process and technology for restoring systems and data after a catastrophic failure (hardware, software, natural disaster).

---

## DR Planning

- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective):** How quickly must systems be restored?
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective):** How much data loss is acceptable?
- **Backups:** Regular, automated, offsite, and tested.
- **Playbooks:** Step-by-step guides for recovery.

---

## High Availability (HA) Patterns

- **Active-Active:** All nodes handle traffic; load is balanced.
- **Active-Passive:** Primary node handles traffic; secondary is standby.
- **Multi-region Deployments:** Reduce impact of regional outages.

---

## Health Checks & Monitoring

- Automated checks for service and database health.
- Remove unhealthy nodes from load balancers.
- Alert on failures and degraded performance.

---

## Handling Data Consistency in Failover

- Synchronous replication for zero data loss.
- Asynchronous for performance, but may lose recent updates.

---

## Testing Reliability

- **Chaos Engineering:** Inject failures to test system responses (Netflixâ€™s Chaos Monkey).
- **Fire Drills:** Simulate outages and practice recovery.
- **Game Days:** Team exercises to improve readiness.

---

## Operational Excellence

- Document and automate failover processes.
- Regularly test and review DR plans.
- Track uptime with SLAs and SLOs.

---

## Cloud DR Strategies

- Use managed services with built-in failover (RDS, Cosmos DB).
- Cross-region replication and backup.
- Snapshots and versioning for object storage.

---

## Cost Considerations

- Balance reliability with cost (more redundancy = higher cost).
- Use spot or preemptible resources for non-essential workloads.

---

## Interview Questions

- How do you design for high availability?
- What is RTO vs. RPO?
- How would you recover from accidental data deletion?
- How do you test disaster recovery plans?

---

## Exercises

- Set up a database with multi-region replication.
- Simulate a failover in a cloud environment.
- Write a DR playbook for a critical service.
- Conduct a fire drill and review results.

## Summary

Reliability and disaster recovery are essential for business resilience. Prepare for failure, automate responses, and practice recovery to minimize downtime and data loss.
