# 10. Storage Systems & File Handling

---

## What Are Storage Systems?

Storage systems provide persistent, reliable, and scalable storage for data and files. They are critical for user uploads, backups, media serving, and application data.

---

## Types of Storage

- **Block Storage:** Raw volumes attached to servers (EBS, iSCSI).
- **File Storage:** Hierarchical files and directories (NFS, SMB, EFS).
- **Object Storage:** Flat namespace, stores blobs with metadata (AWS S3, Azure Blob, GCP Storage).

---

## Object Storage

- Scalable, cheap, and reliable.
- Each object has a unique key, metadata, and data.
- Great for backups, images, videos, logs.

---

## File Uploads and Downloads

- Direct-to-storage uploads (bypass app server for large files).
- Pre-signed URLs for secure, time-limited uploads/downloads.
- Chunked uploads for large files.
- Virus scanning for uploads.

---

## Content Delivery Networks (CDN)

- Distribute static content globally for fast access.
- Reduce latency and server load.
- Examples: Cloudflare, Akamai, AWS CloudFront.

---

## File Versioning and Lifecycle

- Keep multiple versions for rollback.
- Set retention policies for automatic deletion.
- Tiered storage (hot, cold, archive) to optimize costs.

---

## Metadata and Indexing

- Use databases to store metadata for search and organization.
- Index by user, tags, timestamps, etc.

---

## Security

- Encrypt files at rest and in transit.
- Use signed URLs for access control.
- Audit access logs.

---

## Handling Large Files

- Stream files to avoid high memory usage.
- Use multipart uploads and downloads.
- Break into chunks for upload resilience.

---

## Backup and Redundancy

- Replicate data across zones/regions.
- Automate backups and test restores.

---

## Monitoring

- Track storage usage, request volume, errors.
- Alert on failed uploads/downloads.

---

## Cost Management

- Clean up unused files.
- Use storage classes (standard, infrequent access, archive).
- Monitor and optimize egress costs.

---

## Interview Questions

- How would you design a scalable file storage service?
- What are the trade-offs between block and object storage?
- How do you secure user-uploaded files?
- How would you implement file versioning?

---

## Exercises

- Write a script to upload and download files from S3.
- Design a file metadata schema for a photo-sharing app.
- Implement chunked file uploads in a web service.

## Summary

Storage systems are core to many modern applications. Understanding their types, trade-offs, and operational concerns is vital for designing robust, scalable platforms.
