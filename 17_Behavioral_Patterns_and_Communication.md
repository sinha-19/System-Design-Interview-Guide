# 17. Behavioral Patterns & Communication

---

## Why Communication Matters

System design interviews test not just your technical skills but how you think, explain, and collaborate. Good communication can make a strong impression even if your design isn’t perfect.

---

## Behavioral Patterns

- **Clarify First:** Always start by clarifying requirements and constraints.
- **Think Aloud:** Narrate your thought process and reasoning.
- **Iterate:** Present a basic solution, then refine with more detail.
- **Draw Diagrams:** Visuals help convey architecture clearly.
- **Prioritize:** Tackle the most critical components first.
- **Discuss Trade-offs:** Explain pros/cons, alternatives, and why you chose your path.
- **Handle Ambiguity:** Ask questions; don’t assume unspecified requirements.
- **Summarize:** Recap your design and key decisions at the end.

---

## Handling Follow-ups

- Welcome questions and feedback from the interviewer.
- Be ready to pivot or optimize based on new requirements.
- Don’t be defensive—show you can adapt and learn.

---

## Dealing with Uncertainty

- State your assumptions clearly.
- Offer multiple options if needed.
- Explain how you’d validate your design in production.

---

## Time Management

- Spend the first 5 minutes gathering requirements.
- Use the next 10-15 minutes on high-level design.
- Dive deep into 1-2 complex areas.
- Reserve 2-3 minutes for summary and questions.

---

## Communication Do’s and Don’ts

**Do:**
- Use precise, domain-appropriate language.
- Pause to check for understanding.
- Relate design choices to user/business goals.
- Be honest if you don’t know—outline how you’d find the answer.

**Don’t:**
- Ramble or get lost in details.
- Ignore interviewer hints or corrections.
- Rush to a solution without understanding the problem.

## STAR Method for Behavioral Questions

- **Situation:** Describe the context.
- **Task:** What was your responsibility?
- **Action:** What did you do?
- **Result:** What was the outcome?

---

## Example Behavioral Prompts

- Tell me about a time you designed a system under time pressure.
- How do you handle disagreements about architecture?
- Give an example of a time you had to learn a new technology quickly.

---

## Practice Exercises

- Role-play a system design interview with a peer. Focus on clarifying, drawing, and summarizing.
- Prepare STAR answers for three past projects.
- Practice whiteboarding your architecture in under 10 minutes.

---

## Final Tips

- Practice makes perfect—do mock interviews regularly.
- Review feedback to improve both technical and communication skills.
- Stay calm, be curious, and enjoy the process!
